# API Gateway

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at **any scale**.

## API Caching

You can enable it and cache your endpoint's responses. With caching you can reduce the numbers of calls made to your endpoint and also improve the latency of the requests to your Gateway.

## What can API Gateway Do

- Low Cost & Efficient
- Scales Effortlessly
- You can Throttle Requests to prevent attacks
- Connect to CloudWatch for logging

## Same Origin Policy

Under the policy, a web browser permits scripts contained in a first web page to access data in a second web page, but only if both web pages have the same origin.

CORS is one way the server at the other end can relax the same-origin policy

Error - Origin policy cannot be read at the remote resource? - You have to enable CORS on API Gateway.
