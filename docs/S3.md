- S3, S3 IA (low cost), S3 Reduced Redundancy

## Control

Bucket ACL or Bucket Polices.
By Default Buckets are **Private**.

## Versioning

1.  Stores all version (even delete)
2.  Great Backup
3.  Only Suspend

- Bucket Policies
- Access Control Lists

## Encryption.

1.  In Transit. (From PC to Bucket) SSL/TLS

2.  Rest

- Server Side Encryption
  - S3 Managed Keys **SSE S3**
  - AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys. - **SSE-KMS** (provides also audit trails)
  - SSE with Customer provided keys. - **SSE-C**
- Client Side Encryption

## S3 Host static site.
