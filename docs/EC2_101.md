## On Demand.
Short term. Spiky or unpredictable workloads

## Reserved Instances
Predictable useage
Upfront payments
75% less on demand
  - Standard RIs
  - Convertible RIs
  - Scheduled RIs

## Spot Instances
Applications that have flexible start and end times.


## Dedicated
used for regulatory requirements
70% off on demand.

# Instance Types
- D2 Hadoop
- R4 Memory Intensive
- M General Purpose
- G Graphics Intensive
- I High Speed storage
- F big data
- T low cost
- P Machine Learning
- X Memory Optimized

# EBS Elastic block storage
Attached to EC2 instances
Storage Volumes (is a virtual disk)
Replicated.
Root Volumes

- General Purpose SSDs
  - GP2 < 10000 IOPS
- Provisioned IOPS SSDs


# Magnetic EBS Volume Types
- Throuput Optimized ST1 cannot boot
- Cold HDD (SC1) cannot boot
- Magnetic (the only one can boot.)


# Tips
- Types
  1. On Demand
  2. Reserved upfront.
  3. Spot If you terminate it yourself you will be charged.
  4. Dedicated
- Termination protection is turned off by default.
- The root volume is deleted by default.
- The root volume cannot be encrypted (you can use third party tools)
